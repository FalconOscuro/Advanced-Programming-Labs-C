    \section{File Input Output}
        \subsection*{Question:}
            Our program will be required to copy a text file. Therefore the program requires the user to send an input filename and an output filename as arguments.
            Experiment with sending command line arguments to the program.
            
        \subsection*{Solution:}
            \inputminted{cpp}{../01-FileIO/FileIO.cpp}%CPP file path here

        \subsection*{Test Data:}
            Test data is the \textit{input.txt} file.
        
        \subsection*{Sample Output:}
            Program will only output a copy error for now as the \mintinline{cpp}{bool::Copy(char*, char*)}
            is incomplete.

        \subsection*{Reflection:}
            The first and possibly only task which my weird setup makes easier. \\ 
            I don't need to do anything fancy, I can just run the executable
            with added command line arguments.
