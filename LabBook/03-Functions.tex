        \subsection*{Question:}
            Decompile and investigate the effect of functions on assembly code.
            
        \subsection*{Solution:}
            \inputminted{cpp}{../Tasks/03-Functions/Functions.cpp}%CPP file path here

        \subsection*{Test Data:}
            None available.
        
        \subsection*{Sample Output:}
            None available.

        \subsection*{Reflection:}
            Each function argument has its type, register position and copy position relative to the frame pointer register,
            before a function call they are moved into a set of buffer registers and then from the buffer registers
            to the relative copy positions at the start of the function. Function logic is then executed until the frame pointer is popped
            and the program returns to normal execution.
